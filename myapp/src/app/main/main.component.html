        Hey there! Thanks for visiting. I'm a front-end application developer based in Seattle.
        I have experience working as an intern, a contractor and I have experience as a co-founder of a software start-ups.
        My side projects include things like automated farming and IoT applications.
        On my time off, I enjoy recreational sports and exploring different cultures.

        I love startup because, ideally, it offers a safe place to try radial ideas that could change the way to live.
        Over the last years, I've had the opportunity to work at several different start-ups in Seattle WA, USA.

        As people, I believe we're best when we seek to serve one another.
        As a Vietnam native lucky to be living in a first world country;
        I always feel compel to give back - Some domains of interests are education,
        and sustainability living in rural communities.
