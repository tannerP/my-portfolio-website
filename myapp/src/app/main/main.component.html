        Hey there, thanks for visiting. I'm a front-end application developer based in Seattle.
        I quickly accumulated a variety of Software Engineer
        experience after college by working as intern, contractor and founder at different start-ups.
        I'm also a data and automated agriculture enthusiast, I'm looking for ways to make farming more cool.
        When not working, I like to be outdoors, and participate in recreational sports.
        I also spend much of my time in Southeast Asia where the food is always fresh.

      <span id="startup"
            [style.display]="monolog_pane_showorhide('startup')">
        I love startup because it allows radically ideas to form and take shape in a safe environment.
        Over the last years,I've had the opportunity to work at several different start-ups in Seattle WA, USA.
        <br>
        I feel it's inevitable that I will need to run a company of my own because I constantly see things that
        can be improved, especially in Southeast Asia. But for now, I'm thankful for my role as an application engineer.
      </span>
      <span id="people"
            [style.display]="monolog_pane_showorhide('people')">
        As people, I believe we're best when we seek to serve one another.
        I've had the fortunate to live in many different cultures and one thing I
        find true is that people seek meaningful connection.
