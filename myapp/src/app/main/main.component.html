  <h2> About </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
      I'm an application developer. I focus on IoT applications and development.
      I've had the fundamental backgrounds: Physics, Math, Computer Science in my undergrad education.
      In 2015, I shifted my focus toward web application development.
      And by 2016, I was working on a startup with three other people that were, on average, 6 years older than me.
      Of course the startup was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, I grew and learned a ton from building the startup
      with some really passionate people. Now I'm looking for a position as a front-end application developer.
