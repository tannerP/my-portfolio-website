  <meta name="keywords" content="
I'm an application developer. I focus on IoT applications and development.
 I've had the fundamental backgrounds: Physics, Math, Computer Science in formal university undergrad education.
  In 2015, I shifted my focus toward programming.
   And by 2016, I was working on a startup with three other people that were, on average, 6 years older than me.
    Of course the startup was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, I grew and learned a ton from building the startup.
     After that I tried online learning through Udacity,
      where I learned Neural Net and other Machine Learning techniques."
